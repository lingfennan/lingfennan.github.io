<h3>Project Title: <em>Securing Open Source Software Supply Chain</em></h3>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
The broader impact of this project will be to improve cybersecurity. Thousands of open-source software (OSS) packages containing purposefully harmful software (malware) have been reported across popular language ecosystems (e.g., Python), which have been downloaded millions of times. Such attacks are highly damaging as the malware may find its way into apps, potentially compromising the privacy of millions of users; moreover, OSS is the de facto standard way to build modern applications and services.
This project will develop a novel large-scale automated vetting infrastructure to analyze millions of OSS packages and mitigate OSS supply chain attacks. This will enhance productivity for the OSS developer community across the cybersecurity spectrum, including malware analysis, exposing undesired behavior in untrusted third-party OSS code, maintaining developer trust and reputation, detecting hidden software vulnerabilities, and enforcing security of OSS ecosystems.

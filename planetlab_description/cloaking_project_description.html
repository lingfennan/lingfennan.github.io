<h3> Project Title: <em>Simhash-based Dynamic Cloaking Detection</em></h3>

<h3> Project Description:</h3>
Advertisement spam has been rising concern for ad serving companies and users. Abusive advertisers
pay ad serving companies for normal ads, but serve non­compliant content to users, even malicious content.
In order to avoid inspection, ad spammers use user agent, referrer, IP etc based cloaking techniques to
deliver regular content to ad serving company for review, and abusive content to its target users. Among the
cloaking techniques, IP cloaking is very hard to detect. Hence, cloaking detection is a necessary step to
enforce ad policies. There are two major challenges in cloaking detection (A) revealing the uncloaked content
(B) differentiating cloaking from naturally dynamic changes of the same page. Existing approaches pretend to be
the user, e.g. use proxies, set referer, to reveal the uncloaked content, but spammers could detect
and block them. An intuitive way is to collect data from user side directly. However, it is hard to
collect sufficient data for comparison while protecting user privacy.
<br><br>
This work employs simhash to address the two challenges. The proposal is to collect page contents 
simhash on the user side through browser plugin, and compare them to simhash of
the same link from ad serving company to find cloaking. When the differences of
the simhashes are significantly large, we consider
the page to be cloaking. We generate two simhash for page content and structure respectively.
Intuition behind this is, simhash difference between different sites are larger than different
visits of the same site. We build a two­phase system to detect cloaking: cluster learning
phase, and cloaking detection phase. In the cluster learning phase, an ad company visit
ad landing urls and generate simhash from its content with its owned IP, and learn pattern
and distribution of the simhashes. In the cloaking detection phase, the ad company collects
simhash from its users. Compare them with learned patterns, return cloaking score or mismatch.
Results on synthetic data set show that we can achieve more than 99% True positive rate with
5% false positive rate for page content simhash and 100% true positive rate with 2% false
positive rate for structure simhash. If we define cloaking as mismatch in both page
content simhash and structure simhash (intersection of mismatches in both case), we can
achieve more than 99% true positive rate with 1% false positive rate. Results on
real world data is not available now. In order to collect advertisements from
various IPs to detect cloaking, the author plan to use <b>PlanetLab</b> to reach more
location targeted ads.
